# APB-BASED-SPI-MASTER-IP-CORE

Modern System-on-Chip (SoC) designs integrate multiple processing units, memories, and peripherals on a single chip. Efficient communication between these components is achieved using standardized bus protocols. While high-performance buses such as AXI are used for memory-intensive operations, low-speed peripherals like SPI, UART, GPIO, and timers are commonly connected through the Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB), which offers a simpler and lower-power interface.
The APB Interfaced SPI Master IP Core is a Verilog-based RTL design that enables communication between an APB bus and SPI-compatible peripheral devices. It acts as an SPI Master, allowing a processor to control and exchange data with external SPI slaves through the APB interface.

The APB interface is used to configure the SPI controller, write data for transmission, and read the received data through memory-mapped registers. Internally, the SPI Master generates the serial clock, controls the chip select signal, and performs serial data transmission and reception according to the SPI protocol.

This project demonstrates the integration of an on-chip communication protocol (APB) with an off-chip communication protocol (SPI) using a modular RTL design approach. It is intended to provide a simple and reusable SPI Master IP Core suitable for SoC and embedded system applications.
